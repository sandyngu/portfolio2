            <p className="aboutme__text aboutme__text1">My name is Sandy and I am primarily a registered nurse. I graduated from university in 2015 and have been working as a nurse since then. In August 2020 to October 2020, I enrolled in the <span className="highlight">BrainStation Web Development</span> certificate course. I had an amazing time, learning about the webdev world and connecting with like-minded individuals who were seeking to transition their careers into tech. I have always had an interest in tech and this began for me at a very young age. <br/><br/><br/>During my time at the bootcamp, I was given the opportunity to work as a Public Health nurse with my local city to aide in the <span className="red">COVID-19 pandemic</span> response. I took this job opportunity and although it's had its advantages, it also meant putting a pause on my full-stack career. This portfolio, along with other small projects, have been a way for me to help maintain some skills I've learned in the bootcampâ”€ hopefully I am successul in showcasing them.</p>
            <p className="aboutme__text aboutme__text2">Outside of work, I spend an incredible amount of time gaming on my PC. One of my accomplishments is that I was able to build a PC to call my own. I am very much a <span className="rainbow aboutme--bold">supporter of RGB</span>. 
            <br/><br/>Presently, my go-to games are <span className="valorant red">Valorant</span> and Lost Ark. I have been playing Valorant (hardstuck plat) since beta and I play Lost Ark when work is slow (current iLvl is 1370). Before that, I wasted a lot of time playing League of Legends (played for 8 seasons, highest rank achieved was plat 1). Other than gaming, I do enjoy spending time hanging out with loved ones and travelling.</p>
