In August 2020 to October 2020, I enrolled in the <span className="highlight bold">BrainStation Web Development</span> certificate course. I had an amazing time, learning about the webdev world and connecting with like-minded individuals who were seeking to transition their careers into tech. I have always had an interest in tech and this began for me at a very young age. <br/><br/><br/><b>During my time at the bootcamp, I was given the opportunity to work as a <span className="bold">Public Health Nurse</span></b> with my local city to aide in the <span className="red bold">COVID-19 pandemic</span> response. I took this job opportunity and although it's had its advantages, it also meant putting a pause on my full-stack career. This portfolio, along with other small projects, have been a way for me to help maintain some skills I've learned in the bootcampâ”€ hopefully I am successul in showcasing them.</p>
              <p className="aboutme__text aboutme__text2">Outside of work, I spend an incredible amount of time gaming on my PC. One of my accomplishments is that I was able to build a PC to call my own. I am very much a <span className="rainbow aboutme--bold">supporter of RGB</span>. 
              <br/><br/>Presently, my go-to games are <a href="https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/Chawpsticks%23123/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span className="valorant red">Valorant</span></a> and <span className="bold">Lost Ark</span>. I have been playing Valorant (hardstuck plat) since beta and I play Lost Ark when work is slow (current iLvl is 1370). Before that, I wasted a lot of time playing <a href="https://na.op.gg/summoners/na/Chawpsticks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span className="league bold">League of Legends</span></a> (played for 8 seasons, highest rank achieved was plat 1). Other than gaming, I do enjoy spending time hanging out with loved ones and travelling.</p>
